Bought baris.io many years ago for this reason but finding time to blog consistently was really difficult for me. Between work, chores, friends/family, Twitch/YouTube/video games and rest, there was never enough time.
While it also has some drawbacks, one of the few benefits of COVID-19 is that we are working from our homes, so I do not need to commute to work anymore.</description></item></channel></rss>
