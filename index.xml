Bought baris.io many years ago for this reason but finding time to blog consistently was really difficult for me. Between work, chores, friends/family, Twitch/YouTube/video games and rest, there was never enough time.
While it also has some drawbacks, one of the few benefits of COVID-19 is that we are working from our homes, so I do not need to commute to work anymore.</description></item><item><title>Grafana Dashboard for Spring Boot via Micrometer and Prometheus</title><link>https://baris.io/posts/micrometer-spring-boot/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 May 2021 10:10:24 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://baris.io/posts/micrometer-spring-boot/</guid><description>We will be implementing a grafana dashboard with metrics from a prometheus instance, which periodically fetches data from a Spring Boot App. I will keep this implementation as minimal as I can and will create another post with more detailed use cases.
We will begin by generating a simple project on Spring Initialzr
We just need the dependencies to Spring Boot Web, Spring Boot Actuator and Prometheus Registry for Micrometer. Once we import the project and run it, we will see in the logs that actuator is running for 2 endpoints already.</description></item><item><title>OpenMetrics and Prometheus Exposition Format</title><link>https://baris.io/posts/prometheus-exposition-format-openmetrics/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 May 2021 22:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://baris.io/posts/prometheus-exposition-format-openmetrics/</guid><description>OpenMetrics is a CNCF project which aims to standardize the process of exposing metrics in cloud native apps. Specifications for OpenMetrics are public and can be read here
Prometheus Exposition Format OpenMetrics is based on Prometheus Exposition Format. Which is a simple, text-based and human-readable data format with wide adoption in the community.
There were hundreds of integrations around this data format for Prometheus, even some other monitoring tools started reusing it.</description></item><item><title>Anatomy of a Dockerfile</title><link>https://baris.io/posts/anatomy-of-a-dockerfile/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 May 2021 00:00:36 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://baris.io/posts/anatomy-of-a-dockerfile/</guid><description>What is a Dockerfile? Dockerfile is a text document containing commands which can be run in sequence to assemble a docker image.
A sample Dockerfile from the official docs looks like this
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1FROMnode:12-alpineRUN apk add --no-cache python g++ makeWORKDIR/appCOPY . .RUN yarn install --productionCMD [&amp;#34;node&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;src/index.js&amp;#34;]Why do we need them? There are millions of images on dockerhub that we can directly start using with a command like this.
docker run -it --rm -d -p 8080:80 --name web nginx For various reasons, we may want to customize these base images.</description></item><item><title>2021 April Reading List</title><link>https://baris.io/posts/2021-april-reading-list/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Apr 2021 16:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://baris.io/posts/2021-april-reading-list/</guid><description>I will be sharing roughly grouped links to articles or videos I enjoyed during the month and this is the first one.

Even though I really like Java and Spring Boot for large-scale web applications, Python is my go-to language for one-time-scripts, smaller apps and especially aws lambda functions
I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing a lot more python recently, and I really liked a library called typing. typing is a standard library module which provides a runtime to support type hints.</description></item><item><title>Infrastructure as Code</title><link>https://baris.io/posts/infrastructure-as-code/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Apr 2021 00:02:25 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://baris.io/posts/infrastructure-as-code/</guid><description>Infrastructure as Code is the practice of managing and provisioning resources through version controlled definition files.
Things to note beforehand
Cloud providers like AWS, Azure and GCP allow us to provision new resources in mere minutes or even seconds. Multiple deployments to production every day is not an exceptional thing anymore We want to use a similar infrastructure for multiple environments(dev,staging,prod etc.) and regions Infrastructure on cloud does not only mean hosting applications on a virtual machine It also includes services we can use like data stores, queues/topics, network components, access rights/permission models and much more Utilizing these resources efficiently will help us move forward much faster What problem does it solve?</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://baris.io/about/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Apr 2021 00:29:39 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://baris.io/about/</guid><description>Hey, I am Baris ðŸ‘‹ An engineer/geek from Turkey who is currently working and living in Berlin.
This website will serve as a place to share what I am learning and working on. I also want to take more notes and have a deeper understanding of those topics while writing about them.
Things I am interested nowadays Observability / OpenTelemetry and OpenMetrics Infrastructure as Code / Terraform Reactive Java / WebFlux Serverless Computing / AWS Lambda Minimal and fast websites Programming languages I use the most Java Python Javascript I also want to write some code with Rust, Go and Kotlin as well.</description></item><item><title>Observability 101</title><link>https://baris.io/posts/observability/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Apr 2021 23:50:25 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://baris.io/posts/observability/</guid><description>Systems we build and maintain are becoming more complex and abstract with the increase in popularity of distributed systems, microservices, and cloud providers. With these new concepts, our view of failures has changed as well.
We have to assume things can and will break any time. So we have to make sure it is possible to understand what is happening within our services at any given time

If we want to have only a single instance of a class, and it must be accessible from a well-defined access point we can use singletons. In recent years singletons are seen as bad practice but they are still one of the most well-known design patterns. They are used in logging, caching, hardware interfaces, and configuration/properties files.</description></item><item><title>Design Patterns - Builder</title><link>https://baris.io/posts/builder/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Apr 2021 23:48:35 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://baris.io/posts/builder/</guid><description>The builder pattern allows us to write readable and understandable code to build complex objects. It is generally used to handle the construction of objects that contain a lot of parameters. They are usually implemented as static inner classes. StringBuilder is a good example that is used a lot.
But first, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about the alternatives first.
Telescoping constructors In this pattern, we have multiple constructors to support multiple combinations of parameters to create an instance.</description></item></channel></rss>
