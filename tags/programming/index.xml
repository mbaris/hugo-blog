Programming why is python so popular despite being so slow</description></item><item><title>Python Type Hints</title><link>https://baris.io/posts/python-typing/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Apr 2021 00:28:43 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://baris.io/posts/python-typing/</guid><description>The programming language I feel the most proficient and effective in is definitely Java, so I feel more at home with statically typed languages. Even though I really like Java and Spring Boot for large-scale web applications, Python is my go-to language for one-time-scripts, smaller apps and especially aws lambda functions
I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing a lot more python recently, and I really liked a library called typing. typing is a standard library module which provides a runtime to support type hints.</description></item><item><title>Design Patterns - Singleton</title><link>https://baris.io/posts/singleton/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Apr 2021 23:49:53 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://baris.io/posts/singleton/</guid><description>Singleton is a design pattern that limits the instantiation of a class to a single instance and provides global access to it.
If we want to have only a single instance of a class, and it must be accessible from a well-defined access point we can use singletons. In recent years singletons are seen as bad practice but they are still one of the most well-known design patterns. They are used in logging, caching, hardware interfaces, and configuration/properties files.</description></item><item><title>Design Patterns - Builder</title><link>https://baris.io/posts/builder/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Apr 2021 23:48:35 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://baris.io/posts/builder/</guid><description>The builder pattern allows us to write readable and understandable code to build complex objects. It is generally used to handle the construction of objects that contain a lot of parameters. They are usually implemented as static inner classes. StringBuilder is a good example that is used a lot.
But first, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about the alternatives first.
Telescoping constructors In this pattern, we have multiple constructors to support multiple combinations of parameters to create an instance.</description></item></channel></rss>
