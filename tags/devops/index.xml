Things to note beforehand
Cloud providers like AWS, Azure and GCP allow us to provision new resources in mere minutes or even seconds. Multiple deployments to production every day is not an exceptional thing anymore We want to use a similar infrastructure for multiple environments(dev,staging,prod etc.) and regions Infrastructure on cloud does not only mean hosting applications on a virtual machine It also includes services we can use like data stores, queues/topics, network components, access rights/permission models and much more Utilizing these resources efficiently will help us move forward much faster What problem does it solve?</description></item><item><title>Observability 101</title><link>https://baris.io/posts/observability/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Apr 2021 23:50:25 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://baris.io/posts/observability/</guid><description>Systems we build and maintain are becoming more complex and abstract with the increase in popularity of distributed systems, microservices, and cloud providers.
